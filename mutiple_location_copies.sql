 /* This query finds all holdings in a specific location (in this case, any location that includes 'Hortorium' as Cornell has two or more such locations),
and shows other locations that have holdings for the same titles.
First, the subquery finds the Instance IDs for all titles in the main location.
These instance ids are then used in the main query to find other locations' holdings.
The list is in order by call number, then by instance_id (so same titles group together).
The item record count for each holdings record is also included, which allows the user to order by number of volumes in descending order if they want.*/
